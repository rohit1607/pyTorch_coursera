1. Idea seems to be working (third commit). Vplot shows better contours for curriculum learning.
2. Cirriculum learning also seems to be faster (TODO: returns vs training time plot)



TODO:
1. Set up experiment name, logs
2. plot returns vs traing time
3. experiment with more separation and larger grid 
4. try with velocity field - need level set solver
5. two way level sets to prune cirricula
